A [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps) that saves the birthdays of guild members
and congratulates them on their birthday.
In this way, each guild member is reminded of the birthdays of the others.

*Note: If someone does not want to save their birthday, they do not have to!*
