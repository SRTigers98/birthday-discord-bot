# Ground Rules

* Ensure new or changed command work for every input the user can enter.
* Ensure that code that goes into main passes all tests and checks.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* If you add new code or change code, add unit tests for the these.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Cover your changes with unit tests.
   * Tests can be run with **./gradlew test**.
4. If you like the change and think the project could use it, send a pull request.

# How to report a bug

Any security issues should be submitted directly to the security thread in the repositories discussions.
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I change or delete something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. 
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just send us a message in the security thread.

To report a bug, please use the bug issue template.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you have a suggestion for a new feature, please make sure first, that such a feature isn't already on our road map.
Please also ensure there is no open issue for such a feature already to avoid duplicate issues.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in **Ye ol' Birthday Reminder**, you are probably not alone.
There are bound to be others out there with similar needs.
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
Please use for such an issue the feature request issue template.
